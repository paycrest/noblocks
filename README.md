This branch contains the codebase for Noblocks. Noblocks simplifies cryptocurrency-to-local currency conversion using a decentralized liquidity protocol, providing a seamless user experience powered by [Paycrest Protocol](https://paycrest.io/).

## Running Locally

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and switch to the waitlist branch:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/paycrest/noblocks.git
   cd noblocks
   ```

2. Configure environment variables:

   - Copy the [`env.example`](.env.example) file to `.env.local`

     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env.local
     ```

   - Add your privy app ID (`NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID`) to the `.env.local` file.
   - Setup your [Privy](https://www.privy.io/) account by doing the following:
      - Get your app ID: ![image](https://github.com/paycrest/noblocks/blob/main/public/images/Screenshot%202025-02-06%20at%2016.12.19.png)
      - Add your local domain URL: ![image](https://github.com/paycrest/noblocks/blob/main/public/images/Screenshot%202025-02-06%20at%2016.10.44.png?raw=true)
P.S: Check out the privy docs for more information - https://docs.privy.io/guide/react/quickstart

3. Install dependencies and start the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the waitlist page locally.

## üìö How It Works

Noblocks streamlines the conversion process through a simple flow:

1. **Create Order:** User creates an order on the [Gateway Smart Contract](https://github.com/paycrest/contracts) (escrow) through the Noblocks interface.
2. **Aggregate:** Paycrest Protocol Aggregator indexes the order and assigns it to one or more [Provision Nodes](https://github.com/paycrest/provider) run by liquidity providers.
3. **Fulfill:** The provisioning node automatically disburses funds to the recipient's local bank account or mobile money wallet via connections to payment service providers (PSP).
